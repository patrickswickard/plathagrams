T. Sings

A third beachhead bonds men
Methane within a nimble headdress
Here to hug, coalesce an untasted Lent stew
After our hot shots braille wives stir
Hen aid

Oh, avalanche dust enables lucent ewes
Moths plow cubicle fogeys
A svelte unfit pit headache
Otherwise flown pink with it
Olive vixens with esteemed lice, a

Weeknight sin, sweetness nests
Balladry Scrooges shoo selfless filths
My slimy toothed referees
Hi, hammy orgy wagon--await my nub!
It is there, anal litany queen!

Fireside shoe hilts
Herring's towns, gabled horny howls
Hobbled fruit puss
And bar and queue and avenue, porno hymens fell
Clam inundations

Fudge minnow, unmusical wooer
Red greyhounds
Nomad guider
Your hog fathers ahead untie vets
Padded latrine, a swineherd smithy

Trendy menses, a grave stone's a pane
A seedbed's mournful working
While my athlete
Leeches unworthy wry moons
Two shoeshines weep.  Oh nylon creche pervert!

It is marvel soot
Romantic lion
A cheesier hominy hymen
Work it out, twin, win thigh kill
Like an inner piping song I sour, divining rust

A restroom's eccentric thugs
A processed whore's rusty, a softie honors vomit
A ditching spare is thrown
Be elsewhere, Hitler moth, tonight's a hoedown hit!
How no genies

Drag scapegoat nets, buttering a hoagie
Irish piss heel, heathen pie errors
Thrashed queen, earthen loin wife
He wooes a defiant hart
Has ewe stew

His two stiff earners of a hate
Flogging with trued trout
Behind the mouse tofu
Lilies like piss, dong monolith
His pilfering tomcat cause

Hothead yet thug, what birth outwits
A hot fever?  A sequence?  A lover?
Lies.  She is pigheadedness.
Banshee where she
Howls, defying a gross herb wilted rhino.

Shiny owls feign
Shrew header vanes.  Tremble, rioter!
The cricket syndromes, a
Goth veneer, he in lathered kilt.
Ooh the sexual wheat museum!

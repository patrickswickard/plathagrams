A Hot Reflexive Bathrobe
Dried theorist on shadowbox lice
I save moth toy loot, flat quasar cairns ahead
Two waylaid suits, goth fiance fiefdom
Queasy Arab bro
Wearier teeth, unction hinds
The gourds beckoned; is it lox?  As I
Hit it hovering?  Hot evil wave, it
Woke a campy fire ant and it
Winnows onion sites, a creed, a heath tree withers
There is a tilted lynx religion to
My erudite pig, the toy
Radar disk kit
With the wiry fan crashing of females and
Toxin punks.  And furthermore
Mercy ball ringing a ballcock bank
Etch a lemon without
Hesitation, theist!  A mole lamppost falls
Thin unlit eels beg silly label
It is like no Arab mom
My buggered tooth note, lemony beanstalk
My alliteration, I surf you, a
Macaroni seat, a
Mopish livery of a road's bed, a Mexican
Scab, cheeky bent ant.
The nine decayed heron feet I made.  Whitening moth
Why worry?  O, unhinge the dear
Flowered mug toy, downier thief!
Stout dick fluids, a handed jaunt, a bedrock detention rots in
A London bloc mindset.  A bee slithers, unhurt.
Deaf then hot, architect's poetry.
Hie, get it horny, timely mimed game!
And my null feminine virtuoso, a
Honeymoon cruise of a
Sour snout.  Why heed monthly
Twilight tomes?  Wormier bees trode, feel willow
Bloomer.  Oryx panty heist.

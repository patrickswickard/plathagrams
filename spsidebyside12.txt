Latvia!  Sylph,
For Ruth Fainlight
For Faith Hurtling
I know the bottom she says I know it with my great taproot
Booth mitten wok she says I know it with my potato grater
It is what you fear
It is a wafer youth
I do not fear it i have been there
I do not fear it earthen beehive
is it the sea you hear in me
satiety house i hear in me
its dissatisfactions
its dissatisfactions!!!
Or the voice of nothing that was your madness
Or the chive fog notion swathes us mandatory
Love is a shadow
Shoe disavowal
How you lie and cry after it
Heartily of a wide country
listen these are its hooves it has gone off like a horse
hi eel tooth assertiveness telekinesis for a hoof hag
All night I shall gallop thus impetuously
Onslaughts light a hill pall piously mute
Till your head is a stone your pillow a little turf
in a southeasterly idol we roll a trout pitifully
echoing echoing
neigh neigh coco
or shall i bring you the sound of poisons
or shall i bring you out fishpond nooses
this is rain now this big hush
his inhibitors washing huts
and this is the fruit of it tin white like arsenic
hit it forth unsatisfied rice in wealthiest ink
i have suffered the atrocity of sunsets
i have suffered tofu stationery chests
scorched to the root
crocheted too short
my red filaments burn and stand a hand of wires
first men damn understandably fashioned raw
now i break up in  pieces that fly about like clubs
bathos bucketful I tally; i, born a piecewise punk
a wind of such violence
havoc is newfound lice
will tolerate no bystanding i must shriek
debt grows internationally i skim sleuth
the moon also is merciless she would drag me
one schoolmasters similes glued homeward
cruelly being barren
cranberry bugle line	
her radiance scathes me or perhaps i have caught her
a merchandiser teaches her aha corrupt peevish hag
i let her go i let her go
together girlie hole
diminished and flat as after radical surgery
and as famished adulterers carry a fig tin lid
how your bad dreams possess me and endow me
wan possessed demon adores me bawdy humor
i am inhabited by a cry
i harm by cyanide bait
nightly it flaps out
painfully goth tits
looking with its hooks for something to love
no i whisk hog kilts too, ergo fishnet molotov
i am terrified by this dark thing
i am terrified by tight ink shard
that sleeps in me
i stem elephants
all day i feel its soft feathery turnings its malignity
i eat days; sly thirsty lil muffin flea, it is an egg rotten
clouds pass and disperse
drapes pass undisclosed
are those the faces of love the pale irretrievables
oh caves feel feathers too, terrestrial beehive pal?
is it for such i agitate my heart
oft i hit a cherry i mute its saga
i am incapable of more knowledge
i acknowledge no ape frame limbo
what is this this face
i fast i twitch she has
so murderous in its strangle of branches
her fanciness i send sour burglar mottos
its snaky acids hiss
his ass is sticky and
it petrifies the will these are the isolate slow faults
it flips her elite wit we are also faithless lotus teeth
that kill that kill that kill
that kill till talk hath kilt

Elm
(For Ruth Fainlight)

I know the bottom she says I know it with my great taproot
It is what you fear
I do not fear it i have been there
is it the sea you hear in me
its dissatisfactions
Or the voice of nothing that was your madness
Love is a shadow
How you lie and cry after it
listen these are its hooves it has gone off like a horse
All night I shall gallop thus impetuously
Till your head is a stone your pillow a little turf
echoing echoing
or shall i bring you the sound of poisons
this is rain now this big hush
and this is the fruit of it tin white like arsenic
i have suffered the atrocity of sunsets
scorched to the root
my red filaments burn and stand a hand of wires
now i break up in  pieces that fly about like clubs
a wind of such violence
will tolerate no bystanding i must shriek
the moon also is merciless she would drag me
cruelly being barren
her radiance scathes me or perhaps i have caught her
i let her go i let her go
diminished and flat as after radical surgery
how your bad dreams possess me and endow me
i am inhabited by a cry
nightly it flaps out
looking with its hooks for something to love
i am terrified by this dark thing
that sleeps in me
all day i feel its soft feathery turnings its malignity
clouds pass and disperse
are those the faces of love the pale irretrievables
is it for such i agitate my heart
i am incapable of more knowledge
what is this this face
so murderous in its strangle of branches
its snaky acids hiss
it petrifies the will these are the isolate slow faults
that kill that kill that kill

The Enemy and the Two Roe
A cad rodent tilling lymph, this hothead's feint
A knighted scribble mullet, shoe tree hat thief
A dead wet hearse shorts us, leering effigies or minty fog
A fond clergyman's limp kink, grimier humility unhurt
This fruit symposium, a cabinet, this lisp
Fathered moms pry a bead of a snowy storehouse
Sheerer, so white a tiny telescoping totem`
I nod at a fisher nose tic, smooth wino rioting,
A turnip-style bed, I hunt cakewalkers
Sleek Haiti, teargases adrift, timid critique-taker
The peace whippet of gloom, televised air hire
The yawned suctions, the sly ballet treks
Segregate a tofu night, referencing suitor mirth
The detestable horny bean, eight moon yurts
Yet the townie reaps it, a spaceship though
A drifted ninth moon hit flatfeet eyes
I mow ten earth moons, like my she-yeti's thermos,
Her menstrual bungles. A ballasted moon slows
Like wool with double veins.  Teen deniers,
Blandly scented hag teeth coffee effigy.
A myrtle-lit suicide.  Pin nine drab gnomes
And secure a woolly fig.  Wolf girl, anal heaven,
And the lusty cabaret's clime favors the foe.
The billable sullen wit.  The acidic hens rush.
The thong feeds a trillion.  A leftover wet codpiece.
His fifteenth card loss. Thaw nine sad fish.
Dishonest faiths on these moons, a blind held wig.
And emerge, ye lens!  And the sweet lens of the sickness is a black scab.

Bionic Pepper Soot
(for Uther Czeda and Dee Mostel)

Garnishment sucks.  Can TV nun humorists not hone caged lies?
Nor mambo in the unclean wheat?
A caged badge hotshot, he runs your thirst loon wormholes

Agave fig oft lit
Sultry tofu kneader
Bay sky

Napalm-flayed lily
Artistic binging, sexy boney dominoes
A hulled toad brewed nut rolls

Dogma with mayo
The hot stalemate lynched our upshots
A fifer's torsion oft fanned a fowl's cornrow

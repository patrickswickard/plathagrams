Mr Beetle Inventor
The vowel lord
Suddenly turns the truth slot, nicer legs rot
The lithograph a slit trusts
Of the blond rumpus, the mini antenna groin 
Artistic ethic
Stable thick lilt
With clinical twisters, a rib's breakages hiss
A teenager heir inherits
Felted obstacle
Ominous vinyl glitches
And muds whir, aflame
Skin oboe harem, I mutiny
A shadily moist puppy
My nestling owl
And the quiches quench gills, a bed hurting rueful goth
Tipsy ropy hermits
A twisted mayo
Effacing it, I snip
Boas with virility island hour breath
Precolonial spurs
And the collapse of the world's
Hive motel
Like ivy moth hoteliers
The people are glands;
Aim, ignite
My seventy trees
Lighted rhino, oddball sly drug
A unity pork, eight dachas
In holier milt
And there's a damsel's ballet glove.
Violet lace oboe.
Numbed booty,
Wash the twilight askew!
The labial creeper
Bled, the donor of moth death and lumpy geese sleep.

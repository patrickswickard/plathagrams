Ether Egg Tint
So fair with
Wino row faiths
The grilling, a rioting erotica
He oft elevates a lymph mop wheel
The barterer's blini
Lack of kelp rump's buzz
The nuns loved vigor
Like connecting a punch, a nose bun
I saw Sister Rose arise.  Each moist torso a tough visit.
Madding bigamy orgy.
The growth of the crabs, sexy quilt author
Is the wiry tenor firebomb
What head sees thee, Welsh owlet?
Like a corroded sexist fight
The weaver's hill of the ills
And a berried protein helix
Toss the dead, a wonton's killing
This terminal's a toilet
A semitone, a lofty yew
There there, babe--weird bill, free will!
Sit here, much ushered
A heist.  Inspire a snot trust.
Defecate hate.  Wring out a gun, rerevise sunlit vinyl inns.
Decide through wino nut
The moist blonde dwarfs roll the pump
A prom deed is guiltless
The tinting of nun decrees
Had a pool of stills
Hens own thief that fed me lament
Hey, this adapted bump!  Hostile bed spoons!
Not the elite minx!
The heron tux
A dynasty born of workers
His fair tow
Here sit fumed toy men
I herd Dadaist lipstick sand mine pigs

Amused
That standoff of lips, plum toy shotgun
Bewitched sisterly yokels
The capering puss, sea's incoherence
You bandaged hovel girl, your nun house
Of sincere elms
Sooty grouse
Now heedlessly milks a wiry pelting child
Like breathy gunships
The masticated gentry revert a 
Dirtied pine girth, a tent of potions there
True drape
A jigging hairdresser hut
A pier--iced, disowned.
Odd, snowy immunity
Its labia becalm a cornball induced cult
A riotous slum fascinates timekeeping lefties
Rapier
Anyway, Saucy insole area there!
The entitled mynah of a sourer tumble
Preview of a centaur plug
And null zigzag after dead wormy trot
Chucking and ousting
No dull acidity
Dull catatonia idyll
Nether selves, nether vessel
Sooty area, the ovum esteemed
And a planed artefact
A crazier viking gyps the knoll
Orca blight
The bear squeezing the blob fed moth rolls
Fuchsia echo fit a hardbound trowel
And a sensed melody
Like an oversexed proxy, a
Hook, you untidy whore!  A
Commoner, a waif, bury my blue barn!
A belabored stinky oil of youth
Olive belch within it
Thy vaginal cats
Of a tilted asthmatic's hook
Ruinous as cheese whey rungs
Mash tin, sissy!
Only flat coffee feet
Bee enthusing town is there

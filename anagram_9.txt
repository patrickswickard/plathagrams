Scar Tee

Cease, streetcar!
I pour whores
A complicit fanfare, a bonehead yule guru
Named Ghoul Poplin.

Describe a fun tween fee!
You owe a yeti, heaven hove!
Therein cede a pussy's motto:
A tarantula twined Mr. Funk.

Deer cock battle on whitish twill
Time out, ill cow!
Truly bedevil a weiner!
Aircraft neighed fear through ninety fiery genes

Ouch!  Poor men, asthmatic pop
A feathery storm raffles fir quilts
A hypertext roofer:
No fool, a feather hole too!

A career barman sextet.
Nerdy barfing,
Coding--a gyro onion outs you!
Risibly bewitched, whiney hens detect the onion-funk smog

A keen catatonia bunk theft
Pinata loser
To tether drivel
Oh, runt twit!

A bile entity mailbag
Hi, debatable thug!
White irons bathe a rube urethra dew
A petite slithering

Most fleas try, still too debauched
A cabana envelops wet flips
A trachea smoke:
What's witty?  A headboard!

A worthwhile agitated toy!
Herein, a photon's pity;
Tugboat outwits tent
I, lactating kiosk, worn owl tool,

Reemerged, toss hot Egypt pho
Sphincter lathe, a concealed decor
Taut chow
A madame tasted Peeps.

Unjust grated gull sharing worn lint
Lotto befuddles a potent ox
Pancakes fill a moth
Mousy lobe tutu

Bawdy barf
A butchery knife oink,
A leek wife
Heretics set out

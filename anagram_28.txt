Hard Up

Deja
Toothed finesse
The agonized tan

Of gardenia demise
Merciless dog legs
Claiming tea

A fetchingly iris mist
Lava blouse
So heed this, the whorish null soups

And hold us
Moot hymen
Guidelines fit on a cab

Rancorous lapels with cherries
Ragged stinger
Blithely soppy slut

Lentil test
Visit him, ibis eyelid!
Like a grimier moral

This frog vomit, the barricade teaser
Fried horrors molt
Misfit is heeled, I gush

A timeless honking
Sunset's cheerers gulp a renascent pint
And the moth, their beau,

Visits a lint's recruit.
Eye my
Veils I

Obtain a swain oaf connector
His aim
Nine hives

Bean ices
Livery venom
Of a behemoth's lips, sis!

And critiques sleep
A pageant home's warmer caskets 
Or catheters

A Satan of the nested ethyl
Allusion holes
Like the free teacake poncho

Talent of the sand pit
Hale lion souls
One tone

Gather nits
Latched herein
Of that radial sea filly

Scar stylist
A tonsorial limning
A tent stand

And tan test
And testate sphinx
Heal lion souls

Leash lion soul
Sell the malformed Jew
Like a redhead, a short gull

The lesions
The rehab, the ski hint
The cloak of holes

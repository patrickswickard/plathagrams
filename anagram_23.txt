Knitted Chicken Scandal
I still hem in rumba beat hunger
Catalyst sex`wait
And pathetic drinkers
Beneath the worm
A bedded freedom to mix sours
Alack, rabbits!
Swampy haggler wars
Doom is cliched
Like homely wetted lumps
Of cloaca devil cum
Crocodile helices
We are the seventh twine!
Eh...joyless hoot.
Fish death, then fish!
Insets of a creche are pithy,
Five caves oink.
A hair pan
Regrinding ink oil
First communist envoy of titmouse oil
The lanced
Titillated slums and a sprucer's glove
A tiny treeless howl
Tough-heeled, wooed ivory
Be roomy
Be limper, semen veneering
Sour soy periodontics
Dabble--the colon looms!
Bury in you
Pea thin
Now is your soy takeout
Love vole
Hug us, I've won! I have orchestra!
Swift troughs
The trail of vacations
The starlets
Radar disks mottle, deer thump
The electric rum
A camphor-tripped stilt
The libertine well rot
You ethane roe
Alien nose ached, venous pistols
You're the brain, then a baby

A Posh Centrifuge Gout Hut
O, the spry title hairline off the gauche sumo trout!
Head tan, be a tinseling kink quip, worm!
These bear the blackish grease of kind dirt. Skid out!
Both fink and foe, you tear that sad lingerie
Bashed yak vets drove here to the silk
A catbird hotheadedly waits for a sea countess
Toneless neurosis bed and a Dadaist sees grubs
Give the stony origin, needle or June
A networked canyon's bable verse twist
A stout, a segregation town, a rot
And the vinegar veto too, embraces to a servile gnu
The tabbies, the steaks, the sin
And immodest giggler on sadder raw elm
The headstones poke, groin quietuses
A deaf hind hustles machete filth or a nosh house
The bad version of the nozzle like the risks of scum on navel
Look out then, that there is the quilting!  Be a hen!

Ever F 301

What seamen poured it?
Gleeful hen's tooth
As are the pulled dirt lull
Of a bee cloud's flung turrets
How the panacea beetle gets a whiz
Of clinking lace
The tightest hyena innuendoes
The directer sin
The mill end bellies
Of a snuffled dance
Look, rolls!  The wolves love me!
A failed Romeo's smirk as firm virgins cheat
And the fallacies crown each lichen thrown
Now cheese mollusks sully
Lime moth weakeners, inherently wet toil
The drubbed turtle logo nun
Then death.  Coke mink egghead
The wake
Hi suitor!  A chesty bobbin
The gray dishcloth
The gnashing thin drainage, a gin grin
Shaved.  Pilloried.
It hid a dear wet nutrition
I hiked it, and unroll an
Ingot's herbage, a deserted fir soul
And like a high seminarian I shot
These hint sin
A thrilling gland
Believe a neon finch off of frog ink
Seethe, goth shrew; a yeshiva's slackers
A needy thresher's tight
Elm Inn weathercock
Cremate What market?  Were
You a moron?  Poof, Your trainee
Body, your
Humor as the smoldering tartan held a wurst.
A Monday home.
Sane jeep of my papa, blanketed groins
And infanticide till ye fine eleven tiny pixies
You and my ghostliest tooth, my dead nun a
Fly sill maybe, a gauche lime lama
And clogging and mowing, lush loons huffing
Haiku igniting mop
Rakish mini-Yeti
The filthy loom of venial deadbeats
A true palace enemy
Riving
Dress bayonetted
Chubby keys miss brie
Ninth message, whet thy pink beaver
You thin moron
Rim him on horn
My dissolving a vessel, wretched polio tots
Dope tiaras

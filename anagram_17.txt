I gam
Boats thrash; Get cleaner, devil skull!
Yea, son, unloving goths are a reason
She's tethering a lobe bolt, a haversack's offline
Read trolley onion runts, a hebrew tithes a sin
Cheeky luthiers, choral wonks
Earthling, all the hurt, hogtied together
Lora and I, sweetbread pastry luau
A little cabin pilot emulates shovels
She chilled with shirt elimination
A blowhard idleness hems thin toxins
Look!  Each drunk a dimmed colorfast polka!
Heavy hero hit on violent offer
Thence hell, a chastened abyssal rotting
Riflemen hook troy, a then-loved moth
Haste, atheism kitty!  Gadfly retro shop keeper!

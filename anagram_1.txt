Noggin Morns

Veggies loony out like a daft wag cloth
A dimpled heft wipes your byroad and your soft cellos
The clement meek lot stoops again
Yea, a liverwurst outran you, a moving fish concierge
Naked in a dear sensuous fry tummy
We as tall unworldly sandbanks defray a sow's shout:
"Oho, Mr. Roomy Mutineer!"
Tomorrow a lush tonsil addict to stew a flint thirst lecher
Fish defend a new attachment
A monthly ghoul birthrate
A freckle frog tinsmiths, I know a telekinesis sport
Envoys maim a seafarer
A bisected rum nylon and a comfy overflow halberd
A growing inch, tinny vomit
Soup countermen, holy as a watch, a word, a quietness
A runty hassled twin wilts a sultry woodlands snow
Foul, deaf unshorn toy
Like a loon scab lolls the reviewers

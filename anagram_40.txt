Twine Grin
Hematite yetis hiss; thin, neighing, roosted
Whether a scarified live text worm hid.
My, a honey hive
Six fair jots
Excite a sissy, cartwheel linen
Draining out, twine inward, wok with
The threat of a house, the
Rich jest not text, tannest mandala
Myrtle pettifog, battened sloths
Sassing indoors
Moth histories, inner beehive vane
A bedroom, his itchiest inherent velour
A bad elite thinker, kebab tech lunch
Nil goth
The truth and botanic fist
Banal clopping jest, leeches in wooly
Celibacy, a kind sanity.
Nooses piss.
It is they, women who
Intend for finer lucre therein
Granny lotion
This is the mango nightie of the freshest bee bone
Whorish knot, damsel yowl
Filigreed silk loins
The rusty point
A pokey mount.  Invoke the feather.
And spy a negligee, kettle moth
The frown denies,
Deflowers a tension, India soft.  Lethal levity, yet
Itch.  A stolen kitty seethed.
A stony bellman, a wish
Black
Dalmatians, then a twilight
The wiliest of the showmen is 
In my bed solo, a moist feeling, a distressful poet.
Why monitor a sandwich?
Holy tenancy, radiated cherry
Enamel elbow heaters
Orgy and the limos.  A landlady.
Everything a method of the
Stumblers.  Bluntly, he cums.  The robot's
Weiner omits frown
Her tallow knitting the mint as
The dalliance spawns truth of a
Bubbled itchy heron, a bottom hound, a kind dolt
The hive virus will disallow the village
Heifer skirting, Cuba incensed.
Reenter another, a toy
Tattletale, why wish?  A short chemise frosts
A beefy sheltering penetrates thy sight.

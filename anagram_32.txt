Manic Sea

Once unseeing, boozing grunge woes
There it is with a botched ghost union, a full tub, a mutton kibosh
A cashmere yoke sun

Loftily I tweet the 
Haggish desires
And a rabbi's free cuckoo

The seizure of snows and a centrist mudroom
I knit chum
Sandhog nipple

His romps feel ink
With the loin and drawl of it
Lugging his hip owl

Like the dreaded dovecote, a thunderer shits here 
Women deafen a horse
Barber lantern or heater?

A fond anchor looter
Vacant revelry, why tell hotel travelers
A rebirth's restorer, freakish porn gifts

A tacit mole
Faith noted a needfully slim romp
Unerring boniness

A bleeder, a neuron king
Of hermits like radishes, eerie thin toys
Madwomen had ten forklifts, a 

Moist heifer's tower
Is my settee wife hell
Covering vermin enema, never home.

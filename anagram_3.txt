Cathartic Herb Bet

A tapioca fresco flew;
Twigged homing gym tuna, why mow hawthorn blini?
So go ahead--entice taffy vermin
Lightning beds with limits, defeated hive sloth
Insert linguine, a killed peignoir
Noisy fetter hog hilts agitated me
Slapstick bikes
Our hot fine excitement slew a centerfold slowly
Tiny fife headache by eye rug cantata
Unlike a vagrant ax weeder trotter
Heroes wantonly elect goat poet
Refined mummer pigs,
Who'll pester a hinted hawthorn too
Endless marathons deface a felt mesh vest;
Tonight's hunter snoozing.
Respectable knights soil
A cheek, fishbones rest
Oatmeal hen, hide any yacht cad ova!
All this ghastly leg wears a claw,
Hit quickest teeth;
It's nanny's tense, liable flutist!
A dreadful thin son began dull tumult
Cheering a thing within
A heady tie with whom hotheads tilt steel
Kites wheedle yet with a sixtieth decree, a myth
A sitar pinhole, a towhead nod;
Be streetwise with gun
Dreading a nail mink, deepest grout poop too
Untold hissing--quick moth singe
A chronic stone tit killing moles.

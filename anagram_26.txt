Ether Egg Tint

So fair with
Wino row faiths
The grilling, a rioting erotica
He oft elevates a lymph mop wheel
The barterer's blini
Lack of kelp rump's buzz
The nuns loved vigor
Like connecting a punch, a nose bun
I saw Sister Rose arise.  Each moist torso a tough visit.
Madding bigamy orgy.
The growth of the crabs, sexy quilt author
Is the wiry tenor firebomb
What head sees thee, Welsh owlet?
Like a corroded sexist fight
The weaver's hill of the ills
And a berried protein helix
Toss the dead, a wonton's killing
This terminal's a toilet
A semitone, a lofty yew
There there, babe--weird bill, free will!
Sit here, much ushered
A heist.  Inspire a snot trust.
Defecate hate.  Wring out a gun, rerevise sunlit vinyl inns.
Decide through wino nut
The moist blonde dwarfs roll the pump
A prom deed is guiltless
The tinting of nun decrees
Had a pool of stills
Hens own thief that fed me lament
Hey, this adapted bump!  Hostile bed spoons!
Not the elite minx!
The heron tux
A dynasty born of workers
His fair tow
Here sit fumed toy men
I herd Dadaist lipstick sand mine pigs 
Aye, I gather this and inform on Iris
And undo the sanctimony.  Is a finagler smitten?
Eight bargemen sit and hate tints
Like daredevils roll a toy
Fair teeth untied a shoe mitten
A wounded primate
Waif or shit
Lasso limits
Why are goths here?  Testes bloc, can teeth meet a pigtail?
Bawdy moon, hot fetish
Herds shirked Mars and attack
Ominous girly bed figure, a dirndl's cherub lad energy
And downstate onion
Herd and stun gun
The bee news surfeit
Treacle phonies
And the mainlined rigid tin grunt urn
Unclean, uncouth tabbouleh ad
The rigging is radiant, a leftism is cresting
A nail man
Finer death, onion tint seas
The blood pots
A thatch-feet feathered felon
Like the bad hide a puny surplus owl
Callous hint, a daybed thunder
Slut hoteliers hide twinkle wire
Ninety carsick men
Are the crackhead clergy, a sorter is
Fostering this and pink imps.
Forced bandaged fools blossomed a
Macabre poop cloth of the future elk sty
Busy arab ape

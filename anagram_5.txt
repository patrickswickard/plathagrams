Pathetic Plan

A snorter proofs your sofa uteri.
You raw doe!
Cheer a sassy elf eagle, cutthroat!
A cork area hobo
Rebuts a robber's correct rhubarb

Smoothest twitches--so gnomish in nothingness,
Why achieve a tonguing?  Ow!
Pricy tongs
Your henna pod
A preemie pens thy myth ad

Flailing doll nitwit
A strong pedicab nut, a whey-haloed rascal
Dad even without a trolley
Wily rum toy liar
Auditing Easter

But moth youths heartened us yet
A fool's drowned visors
Hmm...faeces kettles work a town
A token--eradicate your skin!
I bash!  Outwit!  Shout!

Bandit tofu bat, black and stiff
Wily rum toy liar
A heft-proof torpor, a swift posterior
A debonair fasting.  Be froth, rough moths!
Burly, oily unit met lye beehive

Run, waxed hooey!  Scum empties ye!
Heave a hot thrift ticket!
Some wee heretic flute toot echoes
Twelfth ad without a yolk, hon!
A sandpaper tot skater

A bittersweet funny ivy--sell evil herbs!
Fold, tiny fig!
Your yokel whore, evading ill love
Nice catatonic woks
Call Kit at Talk Tank

Neither skirt woos, ingrown thigh twit
I evacuate a holy pilothouse
A nauseating mayo eye hive
By a rooster's yurt moistly
I, my airy martyr wit, all rumor I try.

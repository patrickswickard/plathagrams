Hi Varlet

Howl, bleeder muse, the moons you misfiled
Hey, leave out sepia misnomers
Labial misfit, hunting oaf, unbent toughie
You are a ghetto girl, browser of broth
To gut worm's fury; I hear the clouded forest is heaven.

And every ghost nun I get is not origami of fifty turks
Mouse healer, await; Okay, Euro emu
The fire flickering, otters grooming a beastly tunnel, a brick goo
Potful as a wise man burns out on votes
And diagnoses my toy, nuns enable a wright

Her beau sobs, the moon sect joust
The usher is delicious.  India my butt!
The fastidious rays inched thorns onto a 
Rough harem with a trivial groveling.  The silly trout!
A waxen apish blanket and icebox driven moons

You frayed snowman foes, so if
Unfit labia bite back, wink at a fungi groom hymen

For Ann Louise Sorel
Hall rat with
A fine bad hominy nun's motto:
Go quit, peon teeth!
A hot coffee exports ring
So, fink,
A fatal Alp hike?
Die thawed!
Hath thunder spelt,
Little grim lip?
A disputer's onyx enchilada
A wry turkey outlet
Pacers troll
A thrift moth regathers
Petitions
My blotching cutlet
Seats inhibitor, place of ink fizz.
Up, oaf toga!
A lionised rill mourns
A reverend's coyote
Snowy head, or I seethe
Yom
Malicious null hum
Alleviate a hilltop kink
The hint
Flypaper genie
Bears out
Ma, a maze kink
Neon's authority
Zen KKK lug luau ax
A bask hub
Handiness when a tankard rends
Bated hell
Your hateful prop
Falcon's stilt morns
Follicle mines
Who you jump
Perverted antenna
Drily girt
Ms. Butt Hump

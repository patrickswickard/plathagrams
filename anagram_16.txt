Heat & Cod

Wow, a cheese torturer foot!
Firm teepees, natal clown yurts
We see one due knothole hovered, showily spread
Kneel, a silk bed ballad
Be whitish, ox!
A dart heats me; hearth mark birth skirt
Throw a felted carcass
He tuned
Other discord forgiven
A meek barmaid heist
My ions hesitate    CDLPW AE ISIS
The bowel's helm a photography lid
We see the howls melt
Bleak harelip hobos hit into ties 
Mailbox pieces
Let canker filth
I shift gear, hunt teen onion filth
Wheat dongs
Towelette net filth
Home like roosted mesons
The tooth headrest
A sourish panhandle vigil
Bad rats
A rattlebrain mutt's gig
Bad telethons wove
Idiots torn
From a sweetheart's folk
Teamsters hawked a
Laded belt, he
Held belated
Embody food snores

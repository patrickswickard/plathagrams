Mel
For Faith Hurtling
Booth mitten wok she says I know it with my potato grater
It is a wafer youth
I do not fear it earthen beehive
satiety house i hear in me
its dissatisfactions!!!
Or the chive fog notion swathes us mandatory
Shoe disavowal
Heartily of a wide country
hi eel tooth assertiveness telekinesis for a hoof hag
Onslaughts light a hill pall piously mute
in a southeasterly idol we roll a trout pitifully
neigh neigh coco
or shall i bring you out fishpond nooses
his inhibitors washing huts
hit it forth unsatisfied rice in wealthiest ink
i have suffered tofu stationery chests
crocheted too short
first men damn understandably fashioned raw
bathos bucketful I tally; i, born a piecewise punk
havoc is newfound lice
debt grows internationally i skim sleuth
one schoolmasters similes glued homeward
cranberry bugle line	
a merchandiser teaches her aha corrupt peevish hag
together girlie hole
and as famished adulterers carry a fig tin lid
wan possessed demon adores me bawdy humor
i harm by cyanide bait
painfully goth tits
no i whisk hog kilts too, ergo fishnet molotov
i am terrified by tight ink shard
i stem elephants
i eat days; sly thirsty lil muffin flea, it is an egg rotten
drapes pass undisclosed
oh caves feel feathers too, terrestrial beehive pal?
oft i hit a cherry i mute its saga
i acknowledge no ape frame limbo
i fast i twitch she has
her fanciness i send sour burglar mottos
his ass is sticky and
it flips her elite wit we are also faithless lotus teeth
that kill till talk hath kilt

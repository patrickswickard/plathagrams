Mel
(for Faith Hurtling)

Booth mitten wok she says I know it with my potato grater
It is a wafer youth
I do not fear it earthen beehive

Satiety house I hear in me
Its dissatisfactions!!!
Or the chive fog notion swathes us mandatory

Shoe disavowal
Heartily of a wide country
Hi, eel tooth assertiveness, telekinesis for a hoof hag.

Onslaughts light a hill pall piously mute.
In a southeasterly idol we roll a trout pitifully.
Neigh, neigh coco.

Or shall I bring you out fishpond nooses?
His inhibitors washing huts
Hit it forth unsatisfied rice in wealthiest ink

I have suffered tofu stationery chests
Crocheted too short
First men damn understandably, fashioned raw

Bathos bucketful I tally; I, born a piecewise punk
Havoc is newfound lice
Debt grows internationally, I skim sleuth.

One schoolmasters similes glued homeward
Cranberry bugle line	
A merchandiser teaches her: aha, corrupt peevish hag!

Together girlie hole
And as famished adulterers carry a fig tin lid
Wan possessed demon adores me bawdy humor

I harm by cyanide bait
Painfully goth tits
No, I whisk hog kilts too, ergo fishnet molotov

I am terrified by tight ink shard
I stem elephants
I eat days; sly thirsty lil muffin flea, it is an egg rotten

Drapes pass undisclosed
Oh, so caves feel feathers too, terrestrial beehive pal?
Oft I hit a cherry; I mute its saga.

I acknowledge no ape frame limbo
I fast; I twitch, she has
Her fanciness, I send sour burglar mottos.

His ass is sticky and
It flips her elite wit; we are also faithless lotus teeth
That kill till talk hath kilt.

Morning Song
Noggin Morns
Love set you going like a fat gold watch
Veggies loony out like a daft wag cloth
The midwife slapped your footsoles and your bald cry
A dimpled heft wipes your byroad and your soft cellos
Took its place among the elements
The clement meek lot stoops again
Our voices echo, magnifying your arrival.  New statue
Yea, a liverwurst outran you, a moving fish concierge
In a drafty museum your nakedness
Naked in a dear sensuous fry tummy
Shadows our safety.  We stand round blankly as walls
We as tall unworldly sandbanks defray a sow's shout:
I'm no more your mother
"Oho, Mr. Roomy Mutineer!"
Than the cloud that distils a mirror to reflect its own slow
Tomorrow a lush tonsil addict to stew a flint thirst lecher
Effacement at the wind's hand
Fish defend a new attachment
All night your moth-breath
A monthly ghoul birthrate
Flickers among the first pink roses, I wake to listen
A freckle frog tinsmiths, I know a telekinesis sport
A far sea moves in my ear.
Envoys maim a seafarer
One cry, and I stumble from bed, cow-heavy and floral
A bisected rum nylon and a comfy overflow halberd
In my Victorian nightgown.
A growing inch, tinny vomit
Your mouth opens clean as a cat's.  The window square
Soup countermen, holy as a watch, a word, a quietness
Whitens and swallows its dull stars.  And now you try
A runty hassled twin wilts a sultry woodlands snow
Your handful of notes;
Foul, deaf unshorn toy
The clear vowels rise like balloons
Like a loon scab lolls the reviewers

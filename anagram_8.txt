Slit Up
A cheese pilot trio, a tux, bee litterers within
Whenever holy tooth kiwi, questioning, wished, oh wow
Sly beefy stymying quills fleeing a unicameral pen
The boas with eighteen sills had a shed's twentieth shells
A bohemian hood, ivy tined, no twilight ox snoops
A hot putty lecherousness, a hymn damaged my vine vein
A budgeted nosy monstrosity, a thirteenth nosh, my sad toy
A heavy peppered hod myth between the leech and the wistful fop

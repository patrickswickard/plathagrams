Slit Up
A cheese pilot trio, a tux, bee litterers within
Whenever holy tooth kiwi, questioning, wished, oh wow
Sly beefy stymying quills fleeing a unicameral pen
The boas with eighteen sills had a shed's twentieth shells
A bohemian hood, ivy tined, no twilight ox snoops
A hot putty lecherousness, a hymn damaged my vine vein
A budgeted nosy monstrosity, a thirteenth nosh, my sad toy
A heavy peppered hod myth between the leech and the wistful fop
A whitish tilted toll stunt between a wonky wheelie
Pink rhino suit vegetates, a hip putty lid
Honestly, be a trouser; she stuns a sandpaper
Whether a cad insists, a slutty sylph whips linen, agape
A hot jester shot amanuenses, not highhanded grist within
A methane trolley where polio ibis sits most
Hey, boobed lamb, a twisty typist threatened me!
Groovy mouth enlightenments; rusted helmets ebb, pots tint.
They bring me bumbled greens in their thinness, they bring me peels
Ciao, keg thieves' llamas on my bag-off wigs!
A pillbox skillet backache, a penetratingly overt hem
A dachshund, nimbly mild; his mouth got on a toffy pile
Oilskins knot limelights or moisten lice myth chats
Try a carbohydrate igloo!  A light elephant visits.
My bandstand born in glory deems a nun as goth
A gloomy faction's visions ably bear a chewed vest hem
A cornet bender's headgear decently twirls a lollipop
You moron bee's flunkies, maybe sad twitchy meat
Meat Town ad everywhere, finding a hotshot tusk.
Be overseen, wino prune, humane avian! 
Newlywed torsion and a linty twin fad
A puny pet myrtle debuted a withheld snort mutiny
Show it, you heifer, if a head rewove one
Oozy bats disguise the fiancee's pulse
A fake termite's twang, a stagnant hind oinks
Hi, my leafleting minion, a cadet hoisted a whistle
Biochemist's thong untruth like a limo into nutmeat

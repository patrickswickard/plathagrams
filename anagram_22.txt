A Posh Centrifuge Gout Hut
O, the spry title hairline off the gauche sumo trout!
Head tan, be a tinseling kink quip, worm!
These bear the blackish grease of kind dirt. Skid out!
Both fink and foe, you tear that sad lingerie
Bashed yak vets drove here to the silk
A catbird hotheadedly waits for a sea countess
Toneless neurosis bed and a Dadaist sees grubs
Give the stony origin, needle or June
A networked canyon's bible verse twats
A stout, a segregation town, a rot
And the vinegar veto too, embraces to a servile gnu
The tabbies, the steaks, the sin
An immodest giggler, warder on Dad's elm
The headstones poke, groin quietuses
A deaf hind hustles machete filth or a nosh house
The bad version of the nozzle like the risks of scum on navel
Look out then, that there is the quilting!  Be a hen! 
Ablated pie fungi, curb toilette sputum!
A thane's in, it is sundial goiters.
I, a geneticist, a gorgon, and the firefly sits, the moon
Beg a bee, the youth pontoon nuts
The whip of urinary lubing arranging the oven thongs
And the death of a foe exhorts the bastard, the beads dished
A vile motor is a subject
The ashpit nights, mintiest dire ice
See the buboes?  The whey?  The eye?  Stay out!
Airman cork trills are sorry and melt biker hotel
Enhance a snooty clown chore without a grin
I had oafish native teeth, cardamom laced fir resin.  Theft,
Heat, town, your bed-sore toy
Gee, maybe she and they are with snooty Polish Tony!
Their hatred like a flossed gadfly
Oaf, young clod of a northerner
Tanned yenta sin, bodice pen
Soon the nun laments a vomiting

Enhanced Tights
A leafless hermit sling
Bail retriever
Lowly wino had chagrined nuts
Titmice shamans vet moles' heels
A user's launchpad slippers
Elevate thy slurry
Throw leniently, harlots defile Rover;
Hit it, feta segue, bed poet misfit!
Hag stench shredder, a sultry fable Moor
Ill, I seep sillies, oleo slum flyers
Neon sartorial, be herself, hit
Facecloth dodos fell a log
Bargemen tithed slight lifelines
Pandas pressed to flash potato
Tech tomes
Carcasses chop a TV house
Cold chess sun, feel frost's gun
A soft, sour, folksy refugee
Win, Madam, then hurt a gherkin plinth
Peeling bad, needling
Shaven foe's anemia, her black goth hut
I have my wing
A heathen spells tempests
Libelling flakes, fink alleges kiss
His sex wit died
Imply my simony a heresy
A document lightning
Here now

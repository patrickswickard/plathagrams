New Arab Norm

Chime, toothy pet, footfalls elate
Without madmen, a uterus gusts, custard pan torso with pillories 
A furry, oily, uncontaminated spice, a dab, a skinflint's knots
A thin bladed urn tendon bed, limes trill a howler
Ape heart helix!  Electrons kill

Uptight Arab lice filming swami eye
Dead heifer, knot them--a wino's spree, a volleyball ado 
Nope--instead the dead enemies hatch, panning a joint twin and truth
A honey land, the hoof's dreamy moan
A candelabra snake funds mum

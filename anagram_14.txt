Teethed Civet
Heads saith wow, blew new, thin gin
Hither, love; nevertheless, a bed life won, outrun thrum
A turnip optimist's arranging cashews
Whitewash teas, intending owls
Then a halal cheese hook's illusion inverts thirty kooks
The chive thought wroth haste fathead's lily vote
Elsewhere a highrise kiosk tilted a mount ringer's hints
A deeded gloving killer suns a smithy knothole feeling
Ghost tot energies as touchable feet fins
A greener wimp's theft; again, a minnow tallow
A piny adobe patio smothered, sinking
Shellfishes by East Timor--cheerier, then nuking thin!
A chickadee teeth test, a forested hiker hogs a puppy mill
A smoothie kills asthma Indians
One dead onion whets ape death
Atonal blues hide the honey trios
Hilltop elf threesomes help a researcher push tits
A bated sylph heigthens us, a blade tightly spins

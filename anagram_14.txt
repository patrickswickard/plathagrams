Teethed Civet

Heads saith wow, blew new, thin gin
Hither, love; nevertheless, a bed life won, outrun thrum
A turnip optimist's arranging cashews
Whitewash teas, intending owls
Then a halal cheese hook's illusion inverts thirty kooks
The chive thought wroth haste fathead's lily vote
Elsewhere a highrise kiosk tilted a mount ringer's hints
A deeded gloving killer suns a smithy knothole feeling
Ghost tot energies as touchable feet fins
A greener wimp's theft; again, a minnow tallow
A piny adobe patio smothered, sinking
Shellfishes by East Timor--cheerier, then nuking thin!
A chickadee teeth test, a forested hiker hogs a puppy mill
A smoothie kills asthma Indians
One dead onion whets ape death
Atonal blues hide the honey trios
Hilltop elf threesomes help a researcher push tits
A lustier thistle bends, playing heights
Bordered, a humid loon room
Where the fevered satin slits leak wet rot like a lily seller
Work it like a cock fender, mime.  Lie in it.  I do add a
Whitish chef potion.  So is
It of the crevices?  The wrench hurl?  Undiscovered toy frills?
This is a duty.  Ice a showboat.
Soothed bed.  Moonlit lactation, yet
It is a zone of parasitic ova.
Omit fetish hurts, recenter a bedpost
Indecent hosiery, satiable behind a net, a
Thin wisp unmanned as I lurk; unborn we outfight
And kindle wry rot
The bran sex test
Hearth weeders, two shoetree twins
The catlike mellow as a wheel's rut, and between my 
Ship owls, a connectible rend.  Wherefore, sweetheart?
And the tubbiest heron mows shielded moon
Whether a snotty goth deed
Whether an owl tousles better woofer rhythm
Wow!  Awaken a nostril!
There is the horehound's pimp, blame only moons
Esoteric, a horny sweetmeat.  Renal oink.

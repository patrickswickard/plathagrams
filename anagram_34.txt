Addy D.

You odd dodo you noon tot 
A lemony horse back
A lichen like a vivid white hoof
And thirsty heifer, ropy tow oar
Gray beard lint, a career hobo hoot
Validated, you had holy kid
You embodied a fetid heir
Of a favorably dumb egg, a hell
With a slyest goth toy guarantee
As a scab glorifies
A Canadian thrift, and he likes hate.
Here it even ogles our rubber pan.  We
Beat the frown if luau feasts unite
You discover your operetta
Ah, cud
Mint green thong, shout into a pinwheel
The barfly a droll spectre
Far wars, raw sows
Mutton is the bacon of the new mom
My cradle of pink
Today the rawer ears snooze
Where you decline, lotus lover
Tour your ropy foot out
Not you, a tickled velour
My junkie owns the catgut 
It turns, a rabbinic skewer, a
Chi-chi chi-chi
A hip surly deadlock
Every thought was your enigma
And the guano bagel scene
Gee, an engine, an inn
Like a wench muff fife jog
A used jaw's hue, chew a blintz taco
Like a bagel joint tweak
A bleakly white mini-Jew
The clown of the story, the rain of Eve's enabler
A poetry overture rerun
Can recede with my pigs and my sulky wrists
My dandy man, a crackpot pack actor
O I await my beef jab
A desire of you, Lava Bay wenches
With fluffy outwear.  Goodbye, ugly boor.
And a mousy teacher nut
And your burnable eighty year
Nap, a zany prune zoo merman
A swatting, a stud book
Drought; soon balky cock's lush quake
Forty vows, a rinse, a case made
The cabinet, the tofu, the robe
Of a hurt beater brute like you 
You toast the bank card, bald daddy,
I achieve the turnip of you 
Defy onion trout, crucify hot alien oafs
That overfill a bed to noon's nuts
A wanly black mess, hon; the 
Other bed, my twittery print, a
Yeti then saw you when buried.
I denied trite twat toy
And you bat cock, back tab keg
No, the bludgeoned hive, how stout
Pull out the musty cake of the bed
Greece meek and thought slutty, with
Thin tweed and what nook
A domed lime, you oaf
A black lamp, a knife with a mink moon
And a cracker of the wolves and the 
Odd India adios; I
Shyly loom, a thudding fir ad
The beef lactates, the hot folk porno
The stucco's jive, hag-thrown tumor
Veiled ink foil, a violent milkweed
He was the perv who said I am you
And my book for a dreary land
Seventy sworn; If you awaken to
Cold dewy banana dick, you
Ethane asterisk, you halfback ratter
And you avenged the liver killers
They are madcap.  You nod, sinning gnat.
They walk away, you stew sin
You garish moth turd, bad dyad daddy

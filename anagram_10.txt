Other Jail

Newts massage a pert hefty kielbasa's girth
Ahead, a beige hoof's reflected twilit onions, so plump
It weathers them, sees no headstand
Pull a cetacean, whitish moth
Feathery elks trot,
Upend a diver egg barehanded.
Drift, hooting dummy!  Crones evoke hunks.
Canola bats kick.
Wherefore sexual ricotta?
A worm's fleet shivered
Sightseeing moon
A bundled ripply sneeze, a plump gym licensee
Most performed a tilted reburial
Massacred a peach
Bashed bod petrifies a stork
Slog, little mite!
Lo, a disloyally deaf fury thrashes a whippet
Here I ebb, shunning time wig catheters
Perhaps twigs wink, animated preenings
Miming a toothy hatefulness
Fever thistles creak in my rafted fish inn
Rises with wheat, a hymn above
Ideal slimness
Reuse thy silky, hot contraltos 
Sly ushers grate null hippo bridges
My churl gang lucidly sorts a thumbtack finch
Dire moose foam; ninety eels leer.
A bed fisher's hot nun visor.
Ethers hum.
Rim a wok for thy fish ear
A hod soaks his flaming chimes
Die, withered hog!
Mintier liniment arcade
I tithe a weird ivy
A bedded hunk rots, hungover
Mini magi hie
A dustpan-thirsted ointment
Shown how I stain a toy hatemonger head vise
A whorish midway idea
Smithies attest, "Mobilise his pity!"
We load frightened beat truth hawk
If death outvotes tower
Though thawed twill
Who winked, hateful-eyed without soot
Wood moth died out

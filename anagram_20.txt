Padded Pesto

Square loafs bake
Thy crab riot iris
Unearned hag, where a tortured dove hoped
A fun placenta, ill sorority famine cots
A canoodled iron rhyme suicide buyout
Whether stubble regrows, a bee bustier tit whistle 
Stops a thin ad whitener
A loony twerp waddles, his leanest tomato
A whiting swinging hard, soon a rice fetish tryst
Instead slitting in an ancient drifter's lint
Violets twine earthen ivories
Baby watchdog maids foresee a frogmen whim
Alabaster whey, a babe's rhino toy idyl
Incubates till a dust
Heaves a red show yet while a trunk lot
Unyokes your ruins, a vacant hilliness, a mesh.
Howdy, haiku motion!
Cue cell nun!
Whittle a fink, ashamed!
A youth yowl soured heifers;
A sepia pantyliner 
Our lousy soul, your
Coy frill airlift, gritty hacker peril
Postponed homily, defecate porno as truth
A liver binding an irrational oar

Re: You

A pink chapel owl hoisted yon urns
And the stout monks fold eel tears
Like a flesh moon designs malice
The moths wound bonded dooms
Like a null sorrow, a foe's pied puppy
As a daring old rusty work owl
A fifth rump mount as the router
Falls out of a dolly joy
My heftier igloos a thrill
A sandlike vigour leaked off a gloom
A taffeta's flatiron hurrah
Our black tent bade parental dwarves.
A banana dude's mugshot
Like a gel cap, a pink jurist
A speller of lilac peelers
A banana's ex, jumpy mice
Like a lightened slum row
With a canary, a sweet uncool felon

Liver Lug

The groovy, lousy cubed door
A high chili dinghy
And tell a filthy feta as it

Also felt a bad thing on law vises, as it
Wins elk anus
A thriving loon's fence

You, unlike
A cad's ghostwritten hint,
Coil a ukulele loon lullaby

You three bouncy okra
The yoke styes
Ugh, heavy toucan, she permed it

And winding, twining teepee thrift tryst
Their bribes
Silky masons

Oh youth, what eye
The envy of reinforcing a hem, showy ruts are selectively horny
You shaved a whey lout, enlist bitchier peen!

This that and erotica owlet
Pets off!
Eleven fops' fetas like a diocese's thugs nest

That lunatic lube voice--ill verve horn
Hats in a bee eyelet gel
Fate, hon--dahlias' bossy whips!

L'Aire

Sassier inkstands
A cheese tells but then snubs
Dead nun's ricotta proofs
Oldies songs
Wow!  Her own ego!
A freed hunter knows five potholes
Asps stop a silent distress
Watch reborn
A finch tooth neck accent
Grey genie
Bird's caretakers
Shook
A cobbled fellow's tusk mouth;
Sad show!
Menthol sieges
I thrum, a horse laugh
A high shirt
Selfsame folk rhyme
We hit
Upon avid liege,
And he's decanting dad's desire,
And wino
To whom a fig's fate tolerates a
Rich held cyst.
Hamlet will nest
A din.
Wheat armor
While the daftest
Casual idiot with riveted hen
To the diner
Cede, furthering only a moon.

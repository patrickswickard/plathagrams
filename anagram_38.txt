I Get The Bee Men
Who are the bad poltergeist sheep?  A glimmer elevator, the eyeteeth.
The rector?  The midwifes?  The beaten gofer?  The sexton?
My death lie vilenesses, ornery summer civet spoons.
A gloved Neanderthal lady moved yonder bewitched dolly
A rhyming alienated stoking to a vaccinated sleuth's kitten.
A sodomy beckoned, love. As unkind icemen ache,
Her secretary eyes her with biceps, this home of wok theses
My stiff bowstring uncut as men select them.  The fink and toy stork, my
Bee witch tools; lenient mimes kinked a willow
Flee my misty hell, my town far, my real fear.
